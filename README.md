# GBW-Model
The GBW model is a model applied to Saturation Physics where it considers the lepton-hadron interaction through a quark-antiquark dipole. I made this code to apply in my final graduation work in physics. It's not fully optimized, but it's functional and it gave me the necessary calculations I needed.
